My First Accessible Form 
(Mad-Lib Style) ðŸ¤ª

Overview

This repository holds my very first functional form, built in a MADLIB style format. It's not perfect, and it may not be following every best practice but it works. 

I created this form as part of my personal learning journey, overcoming significant accessibility barriers along the way. I didnt have a specialist guiding me. I had to learn by doing, by breaking, by fixing, and figuring things out on my own terms.

Purpose

This project is not meant to be a polished project or a tool for others (yet). It's a milestone, a living record of how I learned to build somehting functional and meaningful to me. 

It represents: 

- learning without formal guidance
- prioritizing what works over what is technically correct
- trusting lived experience as a valid foundation for design
- choosing persistence over perfection

What you'll find inside

-a working MADLIB-style form (HTML/CSS/JS)
-notes and comments that reflect my exploration
-a structure that may evolve into more templates later on

Why It Matters

I built this without an accessibility expert, and I had to unlearn a lot of rules to get here. For someone like me, navigating trauma, vision loss, and systemic barriers - learning to make something functional is an act of resistance and self determination. 

This is code AND recovery AND clarity. It's proof that I'm learning, even without a roadmap that others are holding. 

Next Steps

-improve Accessibility with each new version
-add new templates when I'm ready
-eventually, share lessons learned
